// here we implement a generic BST without using an assisting node data structure. Technically, every node is just a subtree (a single node tree, in the case of an individual node) and so can be represented as a tree instead of a node.
import UIKit

class NodelessBST<T: Comparable> {
    // The characteristics of a tree that make it a BST are that 1. leftchild.value < parentnode.value and 2. rightchild.value > parentnode.value
    // When inserting a node, we must compare the value to the root node. If it's smaller than the root, go left, otherwise go right. Continue this process (recursively) until you can find an empty position where you can place your node.
    // When searching the tree, you do the same thing as insertion. Check root node. If node to search for < root, take left branch, else take right branch.
    // Traversal takes 3 forms - in-order, pre-order, post-order. In-order looks at the left child first, then the parent node, and then at the right child. Pre-order looks at the parent node, then the left and right children. Post-order looks at left and right children and looks at parent node last.
    // In -order looks at nodes from low-high.
    // Deletion can be tricky. If the node being deleted has only one child, it's simple. Have the child now point to the parent.parent and just remove the current node (same as a linked list). If there are two children, however, it is more complex. We must replace the node being removed by the child that is larger than the node (in a balanced BST, this would always be the right child).
